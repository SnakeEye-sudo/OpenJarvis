- Scheduler (calendar, events, reminders)
- Hotword detection (custom, always-on)
- Voice biometrics (speaker verification)
- Live news/weather/sports fetchers
- WhatsApp/SMS/Email integration
- System automation (OS shortcuts)
- Translation (multi-language)
- Learning/tutor mode (education/quiz/flashcards)
- Plugin system (community add-ons)
- GUI dashboard (desktop), mobile companion scaffold, and REST API endpoints

## Architecture
```
Voice In -> STT -> NLU -> AI Core -> Action Router -> TTS -> Voice Out
                         |              |
                         |              └─ Automation/Integrations/Plugins
                         └─ Memory & Context Manager
```
